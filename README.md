In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, spatial data science plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the geographical distribution, patterns, and impact of the virus Spatial data science involves the analysis and interpretation of data with a geographic component, allowing us to explore how COVID-19 spreads across different regions, identify hotspots, and make informed decisions to mitigate its impact
Develop spatial models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in different geographic regions.
To determine maximum cured rate and death rate by countrywise using world dataset. 
To visualize the determined  predictions for each corresponding geographical regions.
Dataset used:
1.WHO Covid-19 Global Data.
2.World country and USA states longitute and latitude.
here,we using preprocessing which is the process of cleaning , integrating datas of a dataset.
The values in the dataset are preprocessed and used accordingly.
Datasets are explored and combined for perfect geographical visualization with cleansed datas
